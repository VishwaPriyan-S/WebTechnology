ICE CREAM ORDERING APPLICATION


OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this project is to develop an Online Ice Cream Ordering System that enables customers to explore various ice cream flavors, view product details such as description and price, and conveniently add their favorite flavors to a shopping cart. Once finalized, the system allows users to confirm their order seamlessly.
The application also includes an admin module, which allows administrators to manage ice cream flavors, update menu details, view order records, and monitor customer feedback.
By integrating features like menu browsing, cart management, order confirmation, and admin control, this system provides users with an enjoyable, interactive, and efficient platform to order ice creams online.
